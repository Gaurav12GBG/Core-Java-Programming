        OOPL :=> Object Oriented Programming Language
              => why ? -> OOP tries to map code instructions with real world making the
                          code short and easier to understand.
            
              => Define-> Solving a problem by creating objects is one of the most
                          popular approaches in programming.
              => What is DRY ? -> Do Not Repeat Yourself (focus on code reusability) .
              
        CLASS => A class is a blueprint for creating objects
            
                [Class]         ==========================>       [Object]
            (Contains info to      Object Instantiation        
              create a valid
                  objects)

        OBJECT => A object is an instantiation of class. When a class is defined , a
                  template (info) is defined.
               => Memory is allocated only after object instantiation.

        HOW MODEL A PROBLEM IN OOPL ?
        => 
                  Noun ==>   Class    ==> Employee
             Adjective ==> Attributes ==> name, age, salary
                  Verb ==>  Methods   ==> getSalary(), increment()
