        ERROR AND EXCEPTION IN JAVA:
        => No matter how smart we are, Errors are our constants companions. With practise we keep getting better at finding and correcting them.

        =>There are three type of errors in java :- Syntax Error
                                                  - Logical Error
                                                  - Runtime Error ----> Also called as Exception !

        => 1) Syntax Error :- When compiler finds a something wrong with our program, it throws a syntax error.

                              int a = 9  ------> No semicolon, syntax error!

                              a = a + 3;

                              d = 4;   --------> Variable no1 declared syntax error!

           2) Logical Error :- A logical errors or a bug occurs, when a program compiles and runs but does the wrong
                               thing.

                             --> Messege delivered wrongly.
                             --> Wrong time of chat being displayed.
                             --> Incorrect redirects !

           3) Runtime Error :- Java may sometimes encounter an error while program is running. These are also called 
                               exception !.
                             - These are encountered due to circumference like bad input and or ) resource 
                               constraints.
                             - EX : user supplies 's' + 5 to a program which adds two numbers.

                             - Syntax error and logical error encountered by the programmer and logical error 
                               encountered by the users.
