        /* 
        OOPs TERMINOLOGY =>
        A] Abstraction   => Hiding internal details {show only essential info !!}.
                            Example -
                                    Use this phone without bothering about how it was made.
        
        B] Encapsulation => The act of putting various components together(in a capsule) 
                            Example -
                                    Laptop is a single entity with wifi + speaker + storage in a single box !.
                         => In java, encapsulation simply means that sensitive data can
                            be hidden from the users.

        C] Inheritance   => The act of deriving new things from existing things.
                            Example -
                                     Rickshow ==> E-Rickshow
                                        Phone ==> Smart Phone
                         => Code reusability  -----------------> (Implements DRY !) 

        D] Polymorphism  => One entity many forms.
                            Example -
                                     Smartphone ==> Phone
                                     Smartphone ==> Calculator
                                     Smartphone ==> Camera
    
        */
    }
