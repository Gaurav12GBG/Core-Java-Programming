            - Translates one statement at a                  - Scans the entire program and translates 
               time into machine code.                           whole of it into machine code.
            - Interpreter needed everytime                   - Once program compiled its not needed
            - partial execution if error                     - No execution if an error occures 
            - Usually easy for programmers                   - Usually not as easy as interpreted ones
