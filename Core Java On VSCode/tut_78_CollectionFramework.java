        COLLECTION IN JAVA : (Advanced Java)
                            - Collection represents a group of object java collection provide classes and 
                              interfaces for us to be able to write code quickly and efficiently.

                            - Why do we need collection?
                                We need collection for efficient storage and better manupulation of data in java.
                                for ex:- We use arrays to store integer but what if we want to
                                         i) Resize this array ?
                                         ii) Insert an element in between ?
                                         iii) Delete an element in array ?
                                         iv) Apply certain operation to change this array ?

                            - How are collection available ?
                                Collection available in java as classes and interfaces.

                            - Following are the commonly used collections:
                              i) ArrayList -> To make for variable size collections 
                              ii) set -> For distinct collection
                              iii) stack -> A LIFO data structure
                              iv) Hashmap -> For storing key-value pairs

                            - Collection class is available in java.util package.

                            - Collection class also provide static method for sorting and searching etc.
